# Etext
*DISCLAIMER* THIS IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT

### How to use
**_Etext_** is a beautiful python text decorator.
### ecolor
How to use a simple color print? simply:
````python
ecolor("Hi this is red text", "red")
````
The second paramater is the color. 
Here are all the colors:
````
blue
red/pink
cyan
white
black
purple
orange
green
````
Here are all the bold colors:
````
bold_blue
bold_red/bold_pink
bold_cyan
bold_purple
bold_orange
bold_green
````
Here are all the decorators: 
````
bold
dim
underline
````
Now that you know everything we can learn some fun stuff!
### Slow print
Slow print is a function that prints text character by character. 
At  the end you have to put the time you want it to sleep (0.025 is my preffered speed).
Example:
```` python
slow_print("Hi this is slow_print", 0.025)
````
That is all for slow print!
### Color slow print
This is slow print but with colors! 
At the end (of course) is sleep time.
Then in the middle paramater is the color(no color changes or decorator changes).
And Then again the first paramater is the text
e. g. :
```python
slow_color("Hi this is COLORFUL! yAYAYYAYAYAYYAYaY!" , "blue", 0.025)
# Then this is it with bold
slow_color("Hi this is COLORFUL! yAYAYYAYAYAYYAYaY!" , "bold_blue", 0.025)
``` 

# How to use
Fork the repl and delete everything in ```main.py``` 
Its **THAT** easy!! 
Also just one thing: You have to KEEP ecolor.py, or it wont work ~~obviously~~, all you really need is ecolor.py. At every start of the file you will want to import: 
```from ecolor import slow_color, slow_print, ecolor```


# Conclusion
For now that is all etext has.
# IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS PLZ COMMENT :DDDDDDDDDDDD
